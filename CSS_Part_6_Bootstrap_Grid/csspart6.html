    <!--Study the theory mentioned above thoroughly and make the accompanying exercises. Now code and style this web page about your chosen topic. Use the Bootstrap Grid to position the content mobile first and different for medium screens and large screens (= at least 2 breakpoints and at least 3 lay-outs!). Add 1 CSS file for extra styling.
    If necessary to prove your knowledge, you can add extra pages to the current folder.
    
    Do not recycle the style of the previous parts: prove you are able to create a different style!
       
    With this styled webpage you have to prove to your teacher that you have a perfect command of the CSS from this part. Don't use code from parts after the mentioned theory!
